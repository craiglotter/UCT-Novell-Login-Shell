UCT Novell Login Shell

UCT Novell Login Shell is a simple Console application written in C# that accesses the local UCT LDAP server to authenticate a given user against the tree as well as check that the user is in fact a member of a specified object group.

Usage: UCT Novell Login Shell.exe <username> <password> <context> <group member
ship> <error level>
where:
 - username: CN value to search on (e.g. clotter)
 - password: password related to the <username>
 - context: context container to search within (e.g. com.main.uct)
 - group membership: desired attribute (e.g. CF_ALLSTAFF)
 - error level: (full) (minimal) (none) denotes the level of status reporting

Possible Results produced by the application are:
Result: 00 - Failure. Unspecified Reason
Result: 01 - Failure. Unable to Connect to any LDAP Server
Result: 02 - Failure. User does not exist in Given Context
Result: 03 - Failure. Incorrect or Expired Password for Given User
